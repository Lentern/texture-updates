# Texture Updates
This resource pack takes HUNDREDS of textures (and other resources) updated in newer versions of Minecraft and backports them to 1.14+. For example, the compass texture was changed in 1.17. As such, this resource pack will implement that texture into 1.14, 1.15 and 1.16.

**These are not my textures. These are made by Mojang Studios, contributors to this project and other sources that I may have borrowed from (ex. VanillaTweaks).**

# How to Use
The best idea is downloading the [latest release of the resource pack from the releases tab](https://github.com/Lentern/Texture-Updates/releases/latest). We support 1.14+ and don't plan to drop versions at the moment. Alternatively, you can download the source from your preferred branch to get the latest changes.

# Contributing
We're always looking for help! If you want to contribute, [take a look at the spreadsheet of fixes](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1r4IKCPRXu4Nl1yRUb2QpNSQo2Nt9WtCJ42dTjg6dtvg/edit?usp=sharing) and submit your own from the available ones. Anything in red or purple is available. From there, create a [pull request](https://github.com/Lentern/Texture-Updates/pulls) for the latest applicible branch and create fixes for all affected versions (if possible). If one fix works for all, simply mention that. If you notice an issue with the spreadsheet, please use Google's suggesting feature instead.

# Q&A
Not FAQ because this is new and doesn't have any frequent questions.

* Why not 1.13 and below?
  - Since versions below 1.14 use the old textures, I do not feel like starting a pack where we update every texture in the game. If contributors are willing to, we may initiate that, but I will not personally start it.
* Why are some updates not implemented?
  - I am not a texture artist. I rely off of my extremely very definitely professional Windows Explorer knowledge and that's about it. If I do not know how to implement something, I will leave it red or purple on the spreadsheet so other people can contribute.
* Why did you rewrite this?
  - The old version was incomplete. I basically shoved a bunch of 1.17 textures into 1.16 and called it a pack. This is a much more complete implementation of everything from that and much more. If you want to download the old version(s), see [oldversions.md](https://github.com/Lentern/Texture-Updates/blob/main/oldversions.md).
